# Squad Builder

Welcome to Squad Builder - your tool for crafting the perfect squad!

## Description

The Squad Builder is a comprehensive and user-friendly tool designed to assist FIFA Ultimate Team enthusiasts in creating, customizing, and visualizing their dream squads. It is inspired by Futbin
Squad Builder but it's designed for teams in a 5 + 1 format, which are more common in real life when
you play with your friends. You can add yourself and other friends as players in the squad.

## Features

- **Player Database**: Access an extensive player database with accurate stats and attributes from the FUT game.
- **Custom Squad Creation**: Click on the positions in the field, then select a player from the list.
- **Add Custom players to the list**: Press the 'Create custom player' button, complete the form, and add
  the player into the list. After that, you can add the custom player card from the list into your squad.
  ==If you change the page from the list, the custom player card will disappear from the list, but if you already added it in squad, it will remain there(you can remove any player from squad anytime).==
